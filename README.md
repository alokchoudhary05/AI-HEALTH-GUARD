## ðŸ’¡Key Features
- **Symptom-Based Disease Prediction:** Utilizes a Naive Bayes model to predict diseases based on user-reported symptoms with high accuracy.
- **Pregnancy-Related Risk Prediction:** Employs a Random Forest algorithm to predict potential pregnancy-related risks. Developed a model using health indicators like BP, blood sugar, body temperature, etc
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Uses Logistic Regression to forecast the likelihood of heart diseases. Utilized 13 features including age, sex, cholesterol levels.
- **Diabetic Disease Prediction:** Focused on predicting diabetes risk using features like glucose, BMI, and insulin levels. Implements Logistic Regression to predict diabetes risk.
- **Personalized Health Recommendations:** Provides tailored medical advice, workouts, and diet plans based on the userâ€™s health data.
